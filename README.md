# About 
Counter Bot is a basic discord counting bot that has option for you to allow user count more than once or the streak will not be reset if messed up
## Installation
I am assuming that you have installed the `discord.py` dependencies
if you don't go to https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/ and it will help you 	on how to install the module
and edit the `config.json` file:
```Javascript
{
    "token": "", // Your token here
    "prefix": ""// Your bot prefix
}
```
## Setup
1. Type`Cstart` to start creating the counting channel.
2. When Counter asks `Creating channel, What's the name of the channel` type counting or any channel name you like.
3. Counter will send the message `#counting has been created, Start counting from 1.` go to the channel and start counting
